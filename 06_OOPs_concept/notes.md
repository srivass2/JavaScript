## Does JavaScript has Classes ?
Ans: JacaScript is basically a prototype-based language not object oriented or function oriented and classes are just syntactic sugar inorder to make other language or class-based developers (Java, C++) have same feel of creating claases and objects but behind the scene JS is still works on prototype-based inheritance mechanism.

## What are Objects?
- collecton of properties and methods.
= properties --> variables, constants.
= methods --> functions like toLowerCase, promises etc.

## Why use OOPs?
earlier codes were getting messy or called sphegatti code(code messy and chuks of code could not be reused). So to avoid this OOPs concept is used.

## parts or components of OOPs
Object literal ( it actually means as the name i.e. literraly one object we are taking about)
constructor functions.
Prototype.
Classes
Instances(new, this)

## 4 pillars of OOPS
Abstraction - hide details. eg. fetch()
Encapsulation - wrapping up of data.
Inheritance - more details when reading prototype.
Polymorphism - many faces or one function does multiple works.
